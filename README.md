# YOLO Object Detection
This repository demonstrates how to perform object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) with the Ultralytics library. The script uses a pre-trained YOLO model to predict bounding boxes and labels for objects in test images.

## Libraries Used
- Ultralytics: Used for integrating YOLO and simplifying the object detection process.
- PIL: Python Imaging Library, used for handling image files.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
- OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision library, used for image processing.
